# networked-game-NE


- Install ```numpy, scipy, pytorch, networkx, dill, cvxpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn```.
- Under the root directory, create two folders: ```data``` and ```result``` (the two folders should be at the same level of ```src```).
- The network game modes used in the simulation are defined in ```Games.py```.
- An example of gradient best-responses to find a Nash equilibrium of a Best-Shot game is in ```bestshot.py```.
- The data needed to run the simulation is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uss99d5xwzgapg5/data.zip?dl=0).
